EvolutionaryPlus package contains some classical evolutionary algorithms and advanced techniques such as differential evolution, covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy,  surrogate model using Gaussian processes, and so on. Users can use them to optimize non-differentiable functions, replace complex problems which need an expensive evaluation cost, or solve some practical issues.  The implementation language is Julia, so it has a better performance in comparison with Python and a more transparent code than C.  This is the early stage of the package, and more evolutionary algorithms will be added. It would be nice if you want to make some contributions to this project and feel free to create a pull request.
